"Cilappatikaram" is an ancient Tamil epic that tells the story of Kannagi and Kovalan, focusing on themes like chastity and justice. These themes are important parts of the story and help to explore ideas about human behavior and fairness.

Kannagi is the main example of chastity, showing incredible loyalty to her husband, Kovalan. Even when Kovalan leaves her for another woman, named Madhavi, Kannagi remains true to him. When Kovalan returns to her after losing everything with Madhavi, Kannagi doesn't get angry. Instead, she forgives him and takes him back. This shows her deep commitment and love, making her a symbol of chastity in the story.

The anklet, which gives the epic its name, plays a big role in showing Kannagi's chastity and how it ties into the story. Kannagi gives her anklet to Kovalan so he can sell it and they can have money to live. But Kovalan is wrongly accused of stealing the queen's anklet, which looks similar. This leads to his unfair execution, showcasing how justice can sometimes go wrong when people in power make quick decisions without proper investigation.

Justice is explored through these events, especially the trial where Kovalan is wrongly found guilty. The king, without checking all the facts, orders Kovalan's death. This highlights how those in power can make mistakes and how the justice system can fail.

Kannagi's response to this unfairness is crucial. She confronts the king, proving that Kovalan didn't steal the anklet by showing her own anklet as evidence. Her bravery in standing up to the king demonstrates her fight for justice and the truth. 

After proving Kovalan's innocence, Kannagi curses the city of Madurai, leading to its destruction. This part of the story shows the idea of divine justice, where her moral chastity gives her the power to bring about a higher form of justice that goes beyond human systems.

In "Cilappatikaram," the themes of chastity and justice are deeply connected. Kannagi's unwavering loyalty gives her the strength and moral authority to seek out the truth and correct the wrong done to her husband. Her journey shows that individual integrity and righteousness can challenge and correct the flaws in society's systems.

The story of Kannagi in "Cilappatikaram" is about more than just personal loyalty. It also critiques the failures in the justice system and supports the idea that true justice is rooted in moral integrity. By following Kannagi's path from a wronged wife to a figure of divine retribution, the epic tells a powerful tale about the connection between personal virtues and the broader concept of justice.
